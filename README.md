# prisoners-dilemma
A text-based simulation of the repeated prisoner's dilemma with different player strategies

The initial agent plays tit-for-tat; the "sneaky cheater" plays tit-for-tit but defects at the end.
The "grudger" plays nice but if you defect, he defects multiple times (holds a grudge).
